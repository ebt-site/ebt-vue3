<p>Thank you for visiting Ebt-Vue3!</p>
<p>Ebt-Vue3 is the successor to <a href="https://voice.suttacentral.net">SuttaCentral Voice</a>,
which provides an accessible interface to the Early Buddhist Texts (EBTs)
found on <a href="httsp:://suttacentral.net">SuttaCentral</a>.
Voice lets you listen to the the EBTs in several different languages,
including Pali, using both AI and human voices.</p>
<p>Ebt-Vue3 extends the accessible interface of Voice in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Click-and-play&quot; lets you directly select the segment you want to hear</li>
<li>Audio data is cached locally to provide a better mobile experience</li>
<li>Content is presented as &quot;cards&quot; that allow for side-by-side sutta comparison on desktop computers</li>
<li>Cards have &quot;tabs&quot; that allows users to switch contexts quickly with a single click</li>
<li>Dark and light themes are both supported in Settings</li>
<li>With Ebt-Vue3, you can create your own EBT website</li>
</ul>
<p>Ebt-Vue3 is not quite ready yet.
We're still working on the bugs, but (it's coming soon...)</p>
