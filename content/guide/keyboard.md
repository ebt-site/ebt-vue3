### Cards

Content is presented within different types of **cards**:

* *Wiki card:* shows website documentation, newsletters, etc.
* *Search cards:*  show search terms and search results
* *Sutta cards:* show individual suttas for segmented documents from [SuttaCentral.net](https://suttacentral.net)

Cards allow you to review multiple documents. 
On wider screens, you will even be able to compare cards side-by-side.

### Card tabs

Each card has a **tab** that can be clicked to scroll to the associated card.
