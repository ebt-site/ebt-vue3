Thank you for visiting Ebt-Vue3!

Ebt-Vue3 is the successor to [SuttaCentral Voice](https://voice.suttacentral.net),
which provides an accessible interface to the Early Buddhist Texts (EBTs) 
found on [SuttaCentral](httsp:://suttacentral.net).
Voice lets you listen to the the EBTs in several different languages, 
including Pali, using both AI and human voices.

Ebt-Vue3 extends the accessible interface of Voice in several ways:

* "Click-and-play" lets you directly select the segment you want to hear
* Audio data is cached locally to provide a better mobile experience
* Content is presented as "cards" that allow for side-by-side sutta comparison on desktop computers
* Cards have "tabs" that allows users to switch contexts quickly with a single click
* Dark and light themes are both supported in Settings
* With Ebt-Vue3, you can create your own EBT website

Ebt-Vue3 is not quite ready yet. 
We're still working on the bugs, but (it's coming soon...)
