### Listen to the Early Buddhist Texts
Voice
provides audio for selected
Early Buddhist Texts (EBTs) and translations available on 
[SuttaCentral](https://suttacentral.net).

Designed for the vision impaired, 
Voice
has a minimalist
user interface that works best with screenreaders.
Voice has an audio player that can be used to
listen to the EBTs while reading them. 
In addition, audio downloads are generated on demand for offline study.
